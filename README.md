## Stakeholders

### *Interviewed: Jason Zhang*
Senior undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics at NYU. Prefers trendy spots that is not so expensive and has a need to buy meals between classes on Mondays and Wednesdays.

**Goals/Desired Functions**: 
- List restaurants frequently visited and recommended by NYU students and faculty members.
- Users should be able to view the estimated cost per person before deciding on a restaurant.
- Need to know real-time data or at least historical data on average waiting times, especially during peak hours.
- Display restaurants based on their distance from a specified location (either from the user's specific location or a campus building).
- Highlight if the restaurant has deal or discount for NYU students.
- Book the seats in advance
- For those tight on time, give an option to order food in advance and simply pick it up (ideal for grabbing a meal between classes).

**Problems/Frustrations**: 
- Having to wait for an available table, especially during busy hours.
- Visiting restaurants without any knowledge about their food and service.
- Difficulty in identifying restaurants that cater specifically to the NYU community or offer special deals.
- Relying on a previously checked price only to discover it's outdated upon arrival, leading to unexpected expenses and a wasted trip.

### *Interviewed: Yash Patel*
Sophomore student majoring in Politics at NYU. Strict vegetarian due to personal and ethical reasons. Prioritizes dining in safe and clean areas, and has a need for parking spots.

**Goals/Desired Functions**: 
- Real-time information on available parking spots near or at the restaurant.
- Allow users to filter restaurants based on specific dietary needs, including vegetarian, kosher, halal, gluten-free, and more.
- Restaurants should provide certified information regarding their adherence to specific dietary standards.
- Suggest restaurants based on a user's past preferences, like parking needs, dietary requirements, and other preferences.
- Offer an integrated system where users can reserve a table and a parking spot at the same time.
- Provide certified reviews from people that have the same dietary needs.

**Problems/Frustrations**: 
- Relying on apps or maps that show available parking spots only to find them occupied upon arrival.
- Finding out a restaurant's "vegetarian" or "halal" dish isn't truly adhering to those standards.
- Feeling constrained to a few restaurants because of strict dietary needs, making dining out monotonous.
- Not having a trusted or standardized system to verify if a restaurant genuinely adheres to specific dietary standards, leading to apprehension and limited trust.
